        <h2>What is StateRep.Me?</h2>
        <p>StateRep.Me was conceived and developed during Hacks4Democracy, a Fall 2012 Azavea-sponsored civic hackathon in Philadelphia, PA.  A collaborative project from Jason Blanchard, Josh Borkowski, Christopher Brown, Joshua Darr, Lauren Gilchrist, Christopher Nies, Andrew Thompson, and Nickolas Weingartner, StateRep.me compiles the votes, press releases, tweets, and Facebook posts of all Pennsylvania state legislators in one simple web portal to enable easy tracking of legislative actions by individual representatives. Searchable by address, the goal of the application is to increase legislator accountability and constituent engagement by reducing the time and effort it takes to monitor the Pennsylvania state legislature.</p>

                    Jason is an education technologist that's fascinated by media/tech/code literacy and social empowerment through technology. He's originally from rural Massachusetts but does, in fact, pronounce his R's (even when drinkin' beeahs at a pahty). He loves being in Philly surrounded by so much open data and talented civic hackers.

                    Chris #1 is a PhD candidate in the Political Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania.  His research focuses on Congress and the application of natural language processing to help answer enduring questions about legislative activity.  Chris #1’s academic experience ranges from research to predict the spread of conventional weapons to using text from the Congressional Record to measure partisan rhetoric on political blogs.  Chris uses a variety of tools to get his work done, including R and Stata for statistical analyses; Python for text processing, web-scraping, and machine learning; and D3.js to produce visualizations for StateRep.Me.  When Chris #1 isn’t working on StateRep.Me he can be found obsessing over his NBA fantasy basketball team, finding some interesting data to scrape off the web, or baking cheesecakes.

                    Lauren is the Manager of Research &amp; Analysis at Center City District (CCD), where she oversees demographic, economic, and real estate research for the city's largest business improvement district (check out some recent work on housing and retail).  A data producer and data user, Lauren brings a unique analytical perspective to the StateRep.Me team and other development projects.  Prior to moving to Philadelphia and joining CCD in September 2012, Lauren was a Research Analyst/Program Manager at the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness (CREC) in Arlington, VA.  At CREC, Lauren managed a federal data delivery innovation project involving the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and  Bureau of Economic Analysis; co-authored a study of U.S. manufacturing using real-time labor market information derived from web scraped job openings and a profile of Arizona's aerospace and defense sector; and supervised web redevelopment projects for the Council for Community &amp; Economic Research and Association of Public Data Users.  Lauren holds an MS in Public Policy &amp; Management from Carnegie Mellon, has lots of opinions about cities and economic development, and tries to keep the StateRep.Me fridge stocked with an excellent selection of beer and cheeses.

                    Chris #2 is a QA Engineer at DLC Solutions, where he ensures website quality (using both manual and automated testing), provides UI/UX feedback and design, and generally raises a ruckus.  Comfortable as a coder as well as a tester, Chris #2 works primarily in Python and JavaScript to develop tools to automate tasks that he doesn't really feel like doing manually (such as API testing and data analysis).  He's put his tool-building skills to work in industries as diverse as locomotive manufacture (GE Transportation), Pharmaceuticals (AstraZeneca), intellectual property law, and (of course) web design.  Passionate about the intersection of technology and urban life, Chris #2 wrote, recorded, and edited a podcast on urbanism and design for over a year, and has since brought his passion for urban living to the Philadelphia civic hacking community.  He enjoys coding, writing about bags, urban cycling, and a good IPA.

                <div class="span7">
                    Andrew is the Community Evangelist at Azavea, where he organizes and attends hackathons (like the Hacks for Democracy where StateRep.me was founded) and fosters growing user communities around Azavea's geospatial open source and API products.  The youngest member of the team, Andrew came to the Philadelphia area from Massachusetts 4 years ago to attend Haverford College.  He graduated in 2012 with a BA in Growth and Structure of Cities and a minor in Computer Science with more than enough other classes in between. The quintessential liberal arts grad, Andrew can talk urban policy and marketing with Lauren, politics with Chris #1, code with Jason and Chris #2, and even handle journalists given his former life as a reporter and editor with The Bi-College News. También, él puede hacer todas estas cosas en español si alguien quiere.  But that doesn't happen often. When he's not helping StateRep.me or at a hackathon for Azavea, you'll probably find Andrew at a Quaker gathering.
