    <h1>About StateRep.Me</h1>
	<article style="color:#FFFFFF">
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>StateRep.Me started during the <a href="http://www.azavea.com/a/hacks-for-democracy">Hacks4Democracy</a> hackathon organized by <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a> and the <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/">Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Foundation</a>. The goal is to provide an easy to use web-app for Pennsylvanians to monitor their state representatives' activities on the web and in government! To that end, StateRep.Me seeks to provide not only raw information similar to websites and services like <a href="http://openstates.org/">OpenStates</a>, <a href="http://votesmart.org/">Project Vote Smart</a>, and <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">Follow the Money</a> - which we rely on for some of our data - but to also provide context to this information for Pennsylvanians. Much of the data on our site is already out there; however, we feel it is hard for average citizens to aggregate and monitor the activities of their state representatives. If you have questions, comments, or concerns send us an <a href="mailto:pastategovtracker@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.</p>
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>This is only the beginning for StateRep.Me - we have a number of ideas for how to help Pennsylvanians become better informed about politics in Harrisburg. We have a number of new features and plans in the works to keep Pennsylvanians informed and elected officials accountable.</p>

            <dt><i>Browse by Topics</i></dt>
                <dd>Right now information for representatives is ordered chronologically. In the next few weeks we also want to organize information by topics to let you browse the activity of your representatives according to the issues you value most.</dd>
            <dt><i>User Registration and Voting</i></dt>
                <dd>We wish to allow users of MyRep.is to register with screenames and allow them to express their approval or disapproval of their representative's actions through "digital votes." These votes can serve as a running tally on your state representatives for when it comes time to vote.</dd>
